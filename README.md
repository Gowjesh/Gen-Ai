Anime Concept:

The anime concept consists of several elements, along with various background characters and backgrounds. These elements make up the main character and lead the story.

Background Characters

(the main characters)

The background characters are the protagonists of a high school drama series. A high school drama series is one where the main characters are young, or young enough to participate in a high school drama competition. In order to be a main character of a high school drama series, the main character has to be of a high school or college grade.

The background characters are also often the main characters of a high school drama competition with a goal of winning the competition.

A high school drama competition is one where the main characters go to school together, and meet each other in the midst of all of a drama competition. In the main characters' own school, they will also compete in the competition.

Plot and Background Characters

(the background characters)

The plot is organized in a simple manner. A character's main character's background may be a single word, an image, or the same character as a character's background.
